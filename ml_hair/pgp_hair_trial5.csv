Both my Mother and Paternal Grandmother seem to have suffered from a degree of mercury poisoning from Gamma 2 Amalgam fillings.  My paternal grandmother suffered from what appeared to be the uniform loss of about 2/3 of her hair, and grey hair, perhaps from mercury poisoning.  The hairline on my forehead receded while I was homeless, keeping my hair in a pony tail, and unable to wash it regularly.  It has stopped receding since returning to proper hygiene."
